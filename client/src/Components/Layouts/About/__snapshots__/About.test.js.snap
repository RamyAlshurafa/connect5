        What is Connect 5?
      </h3>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        Connect 5 is focused on training staff to enable them to support their patients or clients to live well mentally, to better manage their mental health, increase their resilience and ultimately improve wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        The techniques used by Connect 5 are underpinned by the Five Ways to Wellbeing and a cognitive behavioural model for understanding stress, distress and learning tools for self-management.
      </p>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        Connect 5 training is tailored to the needs of your staff – and can take place for between a half-day and two and a half days depending on who it is for and how much support they can provide.

      <h3>
        Why has it been developed?
      </h3>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        With mental health emerging as a pressing priority, and services struggling to cope with the burden, promoting self-management is at the heart of current health and social care policy.
      </p>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        There are currently many obstacles preventing people from accessing the help they need with mental health issues. Stigma associated with mental health means that those not working in mental health often don’t feel skilled or confident enough to speak about mental health issues.
      </p>
      <p
        className="sc-gqjmRU fxnJHh"
      >
        Connect 5 has been developed to help address these problems by releasing some of the core knowledge and skills held by specialist mental health services into the wider health and care workforce, enabling people to feel confident having conversations around health and wellbeing, and make more effective referrals in to mental health services.
